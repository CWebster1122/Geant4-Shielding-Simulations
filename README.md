This repository contains all the files I needed to execute Geant4 particle simulations of neutrons and gammas slamming into different specific shielding materials. Inside the build directory lies a python file called Shielding_Analysis.py. This is my main analysis file with which I create macros for simulations, run the simulation, read in detector data, construct particle appearance matrices, and finally produce heat maps illustrating the particle appearance probabilities. These matrices were intended to be used in conjunction with real-world reactor radiation data to help determine an optimal detector shielding configuration.
